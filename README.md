# ðŸ¤– Telegram bot for Fortnite
### Intro
This project is a simple [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) aimed at [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/) players.<br>
The project is built to be deployed to [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?nc1=h_ls). It is built on [webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks) and the [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).<br>

ðŸ’µ Using the [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), you can host a fully-featured telegram bot <b>for free</b>.<br>

### Features
The bot currently serves 3 functions : 
* â„¹ Fetch the latest battle-royale news and posts them to a group
* ðŸ“Š Display any player's statistics
* ðŸ¥‡ Provide a monthly ranking between members of a group
<br>
Feel free to fork the project, adapt it to your needs and deploy your own version of this bot to your group.
